# Changelog

## version 1.2.0.0

This is a Upgrade w.r.t to the larger upgrade process for the Mobilty set of projects.

This is a dependency for Euler-hs, which is in-turn, a dependency for Mobilty set of projects, thus this needs to be upgraded to newest GHC.

Do not use it for projects other than Mobilty yet, since it uses upstream Beam.

Main changes : -

* Upgrade to stackage lts-20.11 from lts-15.15
* Upgrade to Aeson 2 & Migrate to Aeson 2 with is KeyMap syntax.
* Upgrade to & use upstream Beam instead of internal Forks
